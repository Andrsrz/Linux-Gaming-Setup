# Linux-Gaming-Setup
A python script for allow users to install all the necessary stuff to install for be able to play games on Linux.

- Drivers installer based on Lutris wiki https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Installing-drivers

# Usage ( for now ):
```sudo python3 GamingSetup.py```
# Python Dependencies:
Untill I decide a way for distribute the script with an automatic dependencies installer of easier way, there's the python dependencies list that it will need:
```
pyfiglet, clint, options , distro.
os and sys should be already installed with python thought
```
# TO DO
- Finish the project, ie: adding possible fedora support, add useful and essential programs...
- Create error handler , for basics and common errors, as TypeError, etc...
- Provide as an distributable file, ie: providing a way for install python dependencies automatically
- Create a GUI version


# GUI Version
In the repo of Forknife , it's where the GUI version is being worked on https://github.com/RubixPower/Linux-Gaming-Setup
